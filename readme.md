MYSQL REPAIR TOOLS FOR XAMPP

This is a simple application based on .bat files that is designed to fix the common problems that occur with MySQL in XAMPP, so it can be started without any issues.

The tool is open source, so anyone can develop it without any difficulties. I am aware that there may still be unresolved bugs, so I hope that this application can be further improved and optimized in the future.

## How to Use:

1. Download the MYSQL REPAIR TOOLS File for Windows
2. Open the mysql-repair-tools.bat file
3. Press any key, so a pop-up window will appear
4. Select the directory of your MySQL file (Default C:\xampp\mysql)
5. Press Y to confirm that the directory is correct
6. Wait for the repair process to finish
7. There will be a repair phase 2 option, to configure the my.ini file. We suggest to do it as well.
8. The Command Prompt window will close automatically, and there will be a "data - dd-mm-yyyy" folder as a backup in the mysql directory
9. Test and turn on MySQL in your XAMPP
10. Good luck trying it out.

<b> This script runs on Windows 10 and 11. </b>

## Notes for this script.

This writing aims to convey that this simple script is not a solution to all problems related to MySQL that refuses to activate on XAMPP application. However, this script can help solve many issues related to MySQL. Before using this script, make sure to back up all data as a precaution against any possible scenarios that may occur.
